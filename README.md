# Posy
Compliments for those around you.

**Check it out at [Posy.us](http://www.posy.us/)**

## Features
For small_ish_ communities like colleges and universities, users can anonymously post and comment on messages about the people around them.  Subjects are identified by location and optionally by gender and hair color. For each post, pages attempt to identify comments by the author and multiple comments by the same user to facilitate conversations.

Abusive content can be reported, and content that receives enough reports will be removed until addressed by a page administrator.

## Technologies
* **Back-end:** Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL
* **Front-end:** React.js, Javascript/JQuery, HTML/CSS
* **Testing:** RSpec
* **Deployment:** Heroku
