# Posy

[**View Live / Demo Site**](http://www.posy.us/demo)

## About
Posy was built to learn about **React.js** and to continue gaining experience building with **Ruby on Rails** and testing with **RSpec**.  Along the way, I gained a little experience with **factory_girl** and **AWS CloudFront** (along with a very frustrating CORS restriction on fonts).

Posy is divided into pages for smallish communities like colleges and universities.  Users can anonymously read, post, comment, and report content.  Subjects are identified by location and optionally by hair color and gender.


## Features
* Single page for reading, posting, commenting, and reporting for each location
* Comments are anonymous, but sessions are recorded so that comments are hopefully shown to be by the same person.
* Administrative panel to remove/clear content
* Offensive comment is removed automatically through user reporting
* Responsively designed
* Model unit testing with RSpec


## Technologies
* **Back-end:** Ruby on Rails
* **Front-end:** React.js, Javascript/JQuery, HTML/CSS
* **Testing:** RSpec, factory_girl
* **Deployment:** Heroku, AWS CloudFront
